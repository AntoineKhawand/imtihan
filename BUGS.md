## Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

These are intentional constraints in MVP — document here to avoid re-opening as bugs.

### LaTeX rendering in exported Word/PDF files
**Status:** Known limitation, deferred to v2
**Details:** Math expressions use Unicode approximations (e.g. ∑, π, ²) rather than proper LaTeX rendering in Word/PDF exports. Full rendering requires `mathjax-node` server-side, planned for v2.
**Workaround:** Teachers can copy the LaTeX from the web preview and typeset manually if needed.

### Arabic language not supported
**Status:** Deferred to v1.1
**Details:** RTL layout, Arabic math notation, and font rendering complexity pushed to v1.1. All UI is LTR only in MVP.

### University curriculum — no predefined chapters
**Status:** By design
**Details:** University teachers describe their own course — we don't pre-define chapters. Claude uses the teacher's description + uploaded syllabus as the curriculum source. This means curriculum validation is more lenient for university.

### File upload size limit: 10 MB
**Status:** By design
**Details:** Files are sent base64-encoded in the request body. At 10 MB encoded, this approaches Next.js's body size limit (configured to 10 MB in `next.config.ts`). Large PDFs (>50 pages) should be cropped before upload.

### sessionStorage for workflow state
**Status:** MVP tradeoff
**Details:** If the teacher closes/refreshes the browser mid-workflow, progress is lost. For MVP this is acceptable. v1.1 should persist draft exams to Firestore.

### Free tier: 3 exams lifetime (not monthly)
**Status:** Product decision
**Details:** Antoine confirmed: 3 exams total in the free tier to drive conversion, not 3/month. This may change based on conversion data.

## Reporting a Bug

1. Check this file first — it might already be documented.
2. Check `CLAUDE.md` section 12 "Known Gotchas" — might be a known env issue.
3. If new, add an entry above with the next BUG-XXX number.
4. If urgent (crash / data loss), mark as **Critical** and fix before any other work.
